# Personal Homepage from 1999

Currently hosted at: http://clarus77.zoeetrope.com/

This was my first deployed homepage from back in the late 90s. It was partially built using Claris Home Page which was a WYSIWYG editor on Mac but I also did some handwritten HTML. Back then I was a very big Mac fan and that is clearly reflected in both the content and the design.

The banner at the top of the first page is for a company that doesn't exist anymore so I have left it in for prosperity. It was a company that would pay you when you and your referral viewed ads.

The counter is stuck at the number it had when I salvaged the files from the now defunct hosting provider that the page used to live on. This was back in 2010, I didn't make any changes to the files so they are in the state that I created them back in 1999, mistakes and all.
