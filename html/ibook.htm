         <P><IMG SRC="../images/seperator.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom>The
         much rumored consumer portable from Apple. This low-cost
         light-weight portable is primeraly meant for the education
         market, as one of the goals with it is to run a whole school
         day without having to recharge the batteries. There are
         rumor about Apple including a crank-mechanism to load
         batteries. In that case, 1 minute of cranking should give
         about 40 minutes of battery power.<BR>
         <IMG SRC="../images/seperator.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom>Another
         amazing thing about the iBook is its expected price compared
         with its power. It is expected to outrun the iMac in
         sales!<BR>
         <IMG SRC="../images/seperator.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=bottom>The
         casing is expected to be of the same translusent plastics
         the iMac uses, and is expected to come in several colours.
         Also the casing will be designed to take alot of rough use.
         Testing has been done by dropping them of a school bench!
