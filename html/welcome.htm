I am 16 years old and I live in Sweden now. I have live					in Greece five years, when I was younger. </P>					<P>I have been using Macs for the last five years since we came back					from greece and I have loved every minute of it! In my years with					Macs I think I have tried just about everything! Gaming, Graphics,					Sound, Music, Movies, Web publishing you name it, I've tried it!					But the one thing that I have stayed with, except web design,					is programming. I started programming at the end of 1997. So far					there hasn't been anything worth releasing, mainly unfinnished					projects! </P>					<P>This web site will contain some information about the programming					projects that I believe will someday become something. I will					keep information about things that I am intrested in here and					I will try to keep a gallery of images that I have created. This					web site will also give you a snapshot of who i am, what I do					and how I think. <B>Enjoy the page!</B> </TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD COLSPAN="2" BGCOLOR="White">The picture is of me, Christmas 1997, on a bad hair day ;-) I					might get a colour picture some time </TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>			<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="196">				<TR>					<TD>					<DIV ALIGN="right">You are visitor number 					</DIV></TD>					<TD VALIGN="BOTTOM"><IMG SRC="images/Count.cgi.png"><!--<IMG SRC="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?dd=C|negate=T|ft=0|tr=T|trgb=FFFFFF|pad=0">--></TD>					<TD>!!! </TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>			</P>			<P>			<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="Javascript"><!-- Hide from old browsersdocument.write("Last modified on " + document.lastModified)// Stop hiding from old browsers --></SCRIPT>			&nbsp;</P>		</CENTER>	</BODY></HTML>
