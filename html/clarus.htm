         <P>The Dogcow was first sighted in the Cairo fonts in early
         versions on the MacOS. She was originaly the official mascot
         of the Apple Technical Support. In later days she has become
         so popular that she is a seen everywhere. In fact, she has
         got a jobb doing the page setup dialog for apple printers.
         Clarus aslo has her own statue outside of the Apple
         Headquarters toogether with the famous pen and filling
         bucket from MacPaint.
